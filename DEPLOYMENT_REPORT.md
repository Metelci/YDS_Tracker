# Deployment Report

## Overview
- Target: Material 3 migrated build (Phase 8)
- Date: 2025-09-20
- Owner: Automation pass (Codex)

## Release Preparation
- Command attempted: `./gradlew clean assembleRelease`
- Result: **Failed**
- Blocking issues:
  1. Existing compile errors across validation and UI modules (unresolved resources and duplicate class definitions).
  2. TodayScreen pull-to-refresh still depends on experimental Material APIs that require additional opt-in/dependency reconciliation.

## Internal Testing
- Not started due to failed release build.

## Store Rollout
- Not initiated.

## Monitoring & Feedback
- Crash/analytics monitoring unchanged (pre-migration stack remains in place).
- No new tester feedback collected.

## Next Actions
1. Resolve compile blockers enumerated by `./gradlew clean build` (validation stubs, missing icons in `DataFormatters.kt`, TaskCard composable regressions, etc.).
2. Re-run `./gradlew clean assembleRelease` once compilation passes.
3. Execute smoke tests on physical devices, then prepare staged rollout.
4. Populate this document with rollout metrics and attach Crashlytics dashboard once build succeeds.

## Status
- **Phase 8 remains BLOCKED** pending full app build parity.
