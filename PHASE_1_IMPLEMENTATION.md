#### Technical Requirements:
```kotlin
data class Question(
    val id: String,
    val examType: ExamType, // YDS, YÖKDİL, KPDS, ÜDS
    val questionType: QuestionType, // GRAMMAR, READING, VOCABULARY, LISTENING
    val difficulty: Difficulty, // A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2
    val questionText: String,
    val options: List<String>,
    val correctAnswer: Int,
    val explanation: String, // Turkish explanation

- **By Topic**: Grammar, Reading, Vocabulary, Listening
- **By Difficulty**: Focus on weak areas or challenge advanced topics
- **By Performance**: Practice frequently missed questions
- **Custom Sets**: Create personalized question collections

## Technical Architecture

### Database Design
```
questions/
├── question_bank.db (Room database)
├── assets/questions/ (JSON files for initial data)
└── cache/ (Downloaded question sets)
```

### Key Components
- **QuestionRepository**: Data access layer for questions
- **ExamSessionManager**: Manages active exam sessions
- **AnalyticsEngine**: Processes performance data
- **OfflineManager**: Handles content downloads and sync

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Load questions on-demand to reduce memory usage
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache frequently accessed questions
- **Database Optimization**: Use indexes for fast filtering
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking analytics calculations
