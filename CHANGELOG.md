## Developer Notes

### Technical Implementation Details

#### v1.9.1 Technical Changes
- `TodayViewModel` toggles `isLoading` while loading to drive refresh indicator
- Daily minutes read from `PlanSettingsStore.settingsFlow` based on current weekday

#### v1.9.0 Technical Changes
- Added `PlanSettingsStore` (DataStore) with per-day minutes and custom date format fields
- Plan pipeline: start weekday alignment ‚Üí end date trimming ‚Üí availability-based weekly packing ‚Üí overrides merge
- DataStore: lightweight task logs (time, correctness, category) with simple encoding
- Weakness detection computes incorrect rates per category
- Task IDs remapped to new week numbers; week titles recomputed with localized phase labels

#### v1.8.0 Technical Changes
- `LocalReducedMotion` provider with disabled non-essential animations
- `Analytics.track()` via `WorkManager`; logs only in debug builds; resilient to process death
- Added `Spacing` tokens and `Elevations` for consistent Material 3 theming
- Replaced ad-hoc paddings with 8-pt grid system

#### v1.7.0 Technical Changes
- `PlanSettingsStore` (DataStore) integrated with `PlanRepository`
- Base plan proportionally remapped to target length while preserving pacing
- Lesson screen implemented as placeholder scaffold for future interactive content

#### Migration Considerations
- **v1.7.0**: Changing total duration remaps week numbers/IDs. Existing per-task overrides remain, but dramatic duration changes may misalign overrides. Consider resetting overrides after large schedule changes.
