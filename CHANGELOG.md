#### v1.8.0 Technical Changes
- `LocalReducedMotion` provider with disabled non-essential animations
- `Analytics.track()` via `WorkManager`; logs only in debug builds; resilient to process death
- Added `Spacing` tokens and `Elevations` for consistent Material 3 theming
- Replaced ad-hoc paddings with 8-pt grid system

#### v1.7.0 Technical Changes
- `PlanSettingsStore` (DataStore) integrated with `PlanRepository`
- Base plan proportionally remapped to target length while preserving pacing
- Lesson screen implemented as placeholder scaffold for future interactive content

#### Migration Considerations
- **v1.7.0**: Changing total duration remaps week numbers/IDs. Existing per-task overrides remain, but dramatic duration changes may misalign overrides. Consider resetting overrides after large schedule changes.
