# UX Principles (Sleek Edition)
- **Clarity over clutter**: one primary action per screen; strong hierarchy; generous spacing.
- **Cadence**: short sessions; clear start/finish; minimal choices.
- **Momentum**: streaks/quests are subtle and supportive, never noisy.
- **Time truth**: show time left, avg sec/Q; never hide performance.
- **Comfort**: reader typography controls; dark/sepia; motion that aids cognition.
- **Trust**: security indicators (biometric, HTTPS OK) surfaced as a small status card.
