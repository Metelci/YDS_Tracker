# Screenshots

Add images to illustrate the new Customize feature. Suggested paths (referenced from README):

- docs/screenshots/topbar_customize.png — Top app bar with the “Customize” icon
- docs/screenshots/customize_editor.png — Customize Plan editor with hide/edit/add actions

Tips
- Use an emulator/device at 1080x1920 or higher for crisp images.
- Keep file sizes small (< 1 MB) for repository hygiene.
