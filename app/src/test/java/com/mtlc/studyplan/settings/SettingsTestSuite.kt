/**
 * Test execution guidelines and best practices:
 *
 * 1. Run tests in parallel for faster execution:
 *    ./gradlew test --parallel
 *
 * 2. Generate coverage reports:
 *    ./gradlew jacocoTestReport
 *
 * 3. Run specific test categories:
 *    ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest -Dtest.single=SettingsSearchEngineTest
 *
 * 4. Performance test thresholds:
 *    - Search operations: < 100ms for 1000+ settings
 *    - Backup operations: < 5s for large datasets
 *    - UI interactions: < 16ms frame time
 *
 * 5. Accessibility test requirements:
 *    - All interactive elements must have content descriptions
 *    - Touch targets must be at least 48dp
 *    - Text must have minimum contrast ratios
 *
 * 6. CI/CD Integration:
 *    - Tests run automatically on pull requests
 *    - Minimum 80% code coverage required
 *    - All tests must pass before merge
