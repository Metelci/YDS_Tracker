```

### Week Plan Data
```kotlin
thisWeek: WeekPlan? // Current week's plan data
val totalTasks = thisWeek?.days?.sumOf { it.tasks.size } ?: 0
```

### Navigation Callbacks
```kotlin
onNavigateToPlan: () -> Unit // Switch to Plan tab
onNavigateToStudyPlan: () -> Unit // Navigate to study plan screen
```

## User Interactions

### 1. View Day Details
**Action**: Click on any day card
**Result**: Navigates to Plan tab showing full week view

### 2. Navigate Weeks
**Action**: Click Previous/Next buttons

## Design Features

### Material 3 Design System ✓
- Consistent card shapes (16dp rounded corners)
- Proper color roles (primary, secondary, tertiary containers)
- Typography scale (24sp headers, 16sp body, 13sp details)
- Elevation and depth through tonal elevation
- Responsive spacing (12dp between cards)

### Visual Hierarchy ✓
1. Week header (most prominent, primary container)
2. Navigation controls (secondary importance)
3. Daily schedule (main content area)
4. Quick actions (tertiary actions)
5. Statistics (supplementary info)

### Accessibility ✓

- Content descriptions for icons
- Adequate touch targets (48dp minimum)
- High contrast text colors
- Semantic HTML structure

## State Management

### Reactive Updates
```kotlin
val currentWeek by studyProgressRepository.currentWeek.collectAsState(initial = 1)
val totalTasks = remember(thisWeek) { /* calculation */ }
val weekProgress = remember(completedTasks, totalTasks) { /* calculation */ }
```

### Coroutine Scopes
```kotlin
val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()
scope.launch {
    studyProgressRepository.setManualWeekOverride(newWeek)
}
```

## Progress Calculation

### Week Progress
```kotlin
val weekProgress = completedTasks.toFloat() / totalTasks
// Displayed as percentage: "${(weekProgress * 100).toInt()}%"
```

### Current Day
```kotlin
val currentDayOfWeek = LocalDate.now().dayOfWeek.value
// 1 = Monday, 7 = Sunday
```

### Days Completed
```kotlin
val daysCompleted = if (currentDayOfWeek == 7) 7 else currentDayOfWeek
```

## Integration Points

### Tasks Page Tabs
```kotlin
when (selectedTab) {
    0 -> DailyTab(...)
    1 -> WeeklyTab(...) // ✅ Now functional
    2 -> PlanTab(...)
    3 -> CustomTab(...)
}
```

### Connected Screens
