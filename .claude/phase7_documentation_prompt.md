# üìö Phase 7 ‚Äî Documentation & Knowledge Transfer

**Repo:** `Metelci/YDS_Tracker`  
**Prereqs:** Phases 2‚Äì6 completed (audit ‚Üí migration ‚Üí rewiring ‚Üí removal ‚Üí validation).  
**Mission:** Document the migration, update developer guidelines, and ensure the team can work confidently with the new Material 3 setup.

---

## 7.0 Goals
- Update developer-facing docs (`README.md`, contributing guides, design system docs).  
- Write migration lessons learned for future reference.  
- Ensure onboarding for new devs includes Material 3 practices.  
- Archive migration artifacts (audit reports, migration scripts, snapshots).  

---

## 7.1 Documentation tasks
1. **Repo README.md**  
   - Update screenshots to show Material 3 UI.  
   - Update build/test instructions if anything changed.  
   - Document guardrails (Detekt rules, Gradle checks).  

2. **Developer guide** (`CONTRIBUTING.md` or new `DEVELOPING.md`)  
   - How to use Material 3 components in this repo.  
   - Spacing/color/typography guidelines.  
   - Example code snippets (TopAppBar, NavigationBar, ListItem, PullRefresh).  
   - ‚ÄúDo not use‚Äù section (Material 2, Accompanist, magic dp, raw colors).  

3. **Design system mapping**  
   - Final version of `mapping.json` included in docs.  
   - Explain token usage (colorScheme, spacing constants, typography).  

4. **Migration retrospective**  
   - Create `MIGRATION_LESSONS.md` capturing:  
     - Key blockers and fixes  
     - Best practices learned  
     - Future improvements (e.g., add screenshot testing, improve theming coverage).  

5. **Archive artifacts**  
   - Keep `legacy-usage.csv`, `AUDIT_REPORT.md`, `MIGRATION.md`, `REMOVAL_REPORT.md`, `VALIDATION_REPORT.md` in `/migration-docs/` for historical record.  

---

## 7.2 Deliverables
- Updated `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` / `DEVELOPING.md`.  
- Finalized `mapping.json` in repo docs.  
- `MIGRATION_LESSONS.md` with retrospective notes.  
- Archived migration artifacts under `/migration-docs/`.  

---

## 7.3 Definition of Done
- Docs explain **how to build, test, and extend** the app with Material 3.  
- New developers can follow guidelines without touching legacy code.  
- All migration artifacts stored in one place.  
- Team reviewed & signed off on documentation.
