# üóëÔ∏è Legacy Removal Report ‚Äî StudyPlan (Phase 5)

This document summarizes the cleanup and enforcement after migrating from Material 2 / Accompanist to **Material 3**.

---

## 1. Overview
- **Repo:** Metelci/StudyPlan
- **Branch:** `ui-m3-migration`
- **Date:** 2025-09-20
- **Agent:** Claude Code (Sonnet 4)

**Goal:** Remove all legacy code, resources, and dependencies, and enforce permanent guardrails against regression.

---

## 2. Legacy Code Removed
*(List of deleted or refactored files/components)*

| File/Module | Legacy Component(s) | Action |
|-------------|----------------------|--------|
| `app/build.gradle.kts` | `androidx.compose.material:material` | Dependency removed |
| Various Kotlin files | `androidx.compose.material.*` imports | ‚úÖ Zero occurrences found |
| Various Kotlin files | `com.google.accompanist.*` imports | ‚úÖ Zero occurrences found |
| Various Kotlin files | `MaterialTheme.colors` usage | ‚úÖ Zero occurrences found |
| Settings adapters | XML-based RecyclerView adapters | Identified but preserved (may be in use) |

---

## 3. Dependencies
- **Removed:**
  - `androidx.compose.material:material` (Material 2 dependency) ‚úÖ Removed
  - No `com.google.accompanist:accompanist-swiperefresh` found ‚úÖ

- **Verified Present (M3 only):**
  - `androidx.compose.material3:material3` ‚úÖ Present in libs.versions.toml
  - Standard Compose dependencies maintained

---

## 4. Adapters Removed
- [‚ö†Ô∏è] Legacy XML-based settings adapters identified but preserved (need verification if still in use)
- [‚úÖ] No temporary adapter components from Phase 3 found
- [‚úÖ] Zero references to legacy Material 2 APIs found

---

## 5. Guardrails Enforced
- **Detekt rule** ‚úÖ Active: blocks `androidx.compose.material` and `com.google.accompanist.swiperefresh`
- **Detekt configuration**: `detekt.yml` in project root with ForbiddenImport rules
- **Gradle checks**: Legacy dependency removed, preventing reintroduction
- **CI validation**: Detekt rules will catch any legacy imports in CI

---

## 6. Verification
- ‚úÖ Legacy dependency scan shows **zero Material 2 imports**
- ‚úÖ Legacy dependency scan shows **zero Accompanist imports**
- ‚úÖ Legacy dependency scan shows **zero MaterialTheme.colors usage**
- ‚úÖ Removed `androidx.compose.material:material` from build.gradle.kts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Build verification deferred (Windows environment constraints)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Settings XML adapters require further review

---

## 7. Remaining Work / TODOs
- [ ] Review settings XML adapters for potential removal (if fully migrated to Compose)
- [ ] Run full build verification: `./gradlew build`
- [ ] Run test suite: `./gradlew test`
- [ ] Confirm dark mode and RTL layouts unaffected
- [ ] Final design QA with UI/UX team

---

## 8. Final Sign-off
- **Developer:** Claude Code (Phase 5 Complete)
- **Reviewer:** Pending human review
- **Date:** 2025-09-20

## Summary

**Phase 5 Legacy Removal Status: ‚úÖ LARGELY COMPLETE**

‚úÖ **Completed:**
- Removed legacy Material 2 dependency (`androidx.compose.material:material`)
- Verified zero legacy imports in codebase
- Confirmed Detekt guardrails are active
- Updated REMOVAL_REPORT.md with findings

‚ö†Ô∏è **Pending:**
