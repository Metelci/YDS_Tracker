# StudyPlan Application - Architecture & Performance Optimizations Summary

This document summarizes all the architectural and performance optimizations implemented in the StudyPlan application to improve efficiency, memory usage, and overall user experience.

## 1. Database Query Optimizations ✅

### Indexing Improvements
- Added composite indexes in `StudyPlanDatabase.kt` (version 5):
  - `idx_tasks_active_priority_due`: For active tasks ordered by priority and due date
  - `idx_tasks_active_completed_priority`: For filtering by completion status and priority
  - `idx_tasks_category_priority`: For category-based prioritization
  - Additional strategic indexes for common access patterns

### Query Efficiency
- Replaced SQLite date functions with application-level date calculations in `TaskDao.kt`:
  - `getTomorrowTasks()`: Parameterized with start/end of day
  - `getUpcomingTasks()`: Parameterized with date ranges
  - `getTodayCompletedCount()`: Uses proper date ranges
  - `getCompletedTasksForDate()`: Uses proper date ranges
  - `getTodayStudyMinutes()`: Uses proper date ranges
  - `getTodayPointsEarned()`: Uses proper date ranges
  - `getStreakTasksForDate()`: Uses proper date ranges

## 2. Repository Layer Optimizations ✅

### Flow Consolidation
- Consolidated multiple reactive flows in `TaskRepository.kt`:
  - Combined `totalTaskCount`, `pendingTaskCount`, `completedTaskCount`, `overdueTaskCount` into a single `taskCounts` flow
  - Reduced database queries by computing counts from a single source
  - Maintained backward compatibility with individual count flows

### Dynamic Date Calculation
- Fixed static date calculation bug in `todayTasks` flow
- Implemented dynamic calculation that updates when day changes
- Added proper refresh mechanisms for date-sensitive data

- Replaced custom LRU cache implementation with Android's built-in `LruCache`
- Improved cache sizing based on available memory
- Added proper cache expiration and invalidation strategies

## 3. UI/Performance Optimizations ✅

- Added avatar-specific optimization utilities
  - Circular cropping with face detection
  - Size optimization based on screen density
  - Memory-aware loading strategies

## 8. Transaction Management ✅

### Batch Operations
- Enhanced `TaskDao.kt` with comprehensive batch operations:
  - `@Transaction` annotations for consistency
  - Batch update methods for better performance
  - Proper error handling in transactions

### Repository Integration
- Updated `TaskRepository.kt` to use enhanced batch operations
  - Consolidated multiple operations into single transactions
